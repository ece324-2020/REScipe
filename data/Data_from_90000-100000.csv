Close bags, shake gently to distribute buttermilk over chicken pieces, then refrigerate at least 2 hours or up to 1 day.
To fry: In a 9- by 13-inch baking pan, mix together flour, salt, and pepper until combined; set aside. Place shortening in a heavy 5- to 6-quart pan.

Adjust heat to keep oil at 350 degrees and fry chicken until crisp, golden brown, and no longer pink in center of thickest part (cut to test), about 12 minutes total for drumsticks, thighs, and wings, about 14 minutes total for breasts. (Lower temperature to 325 degrees if chicken skin is browning too quickly.) Turn pieces over halfway through for even browning. (If you have a splatter guard, you can place it on top of the pan while the chicken cooks.)
When chicken pieces are done, remove them from the oil and drain briefly on paper-towel-lined platter. Then, using tongs, transfer chicken to wire rack in baking pan. Transfer pan to oven and keep chicken warm until all pieces are cooked.
Return oil to 350 degrees (or 325 degrees if excessive darkening is a problem) and repeat steps 3 through 5 until all the chicken is cooked."

Pour in the water all at once and quickly mix with a sturdy spoon. Additional water may be necessary to moisten all of the dry gluten. Don't worry that the ball is rather solid, it is supposed to be. Pour off any excess water.
If you want your ribs chewy, leave the ball just as it is. If you want it slightly less chewy, remove it from the bowl and knead for 1 to 2 minutes on a clean surface. Return it to the bowl, and coat with smooth peanut butter. Set aside.
Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until golden brown. Remove from the heat. Pour the onion and oil over the ball of gluten. Poke a few times with a chopstick, knife or even a fork, allowing the oil to soak into the ball. Let cool.
When the ball is just warm enough to be manageable, use your hands to mix the oil and onions in. There will be a lot of oil that will not mix in and tiny pieces of gluten that will not stay attached. That's okay. The oil mainly helps the gluten absorb the spice. Just mix as much as you can.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Break off good sized handfuls of dough and shape them into strips by pulling and twisting. You want them to be about 4 inches long and 1/2 inch thick.
